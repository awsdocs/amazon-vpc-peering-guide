This section describes VPC peering connection configurations that are invalid\.

## Overlapping CIDR Blocks<a name="overlapping-cidr"></a>

You cannot create a VPC peering connection between VPCs with matching or overlapping IPv4 CIDR blocks\. 

![\[VPCs with matching IPv4 CIDR blocks\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/images/overlapping-cidrs-diagram.png)

If the VPCs have multiple IPv4 CIDR blocks, you cannot create a VPC peering connection if any of the CIDR blocks overlap \(regardless of whether you intend to use the VPC peering connection for communication between the non\-overlapping CIDR blocks only\)\.

![\[VPCs with overlapping IPv4 CIDR blocks\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/images/overlapping-multiple-cidrs-diagram.png)

This limitation also applies to VPCs that have non\-overlapping IPv6 CIDR blocks\. Even if you intend to use the VPC peering connection for IPv6 communication only, you cannot create a VPC peering connection if the VPCs have matching or overlapping IPv4 CIDR blocks\. 

Communication over IPv6 is not supported for an inter\-region VPC peering connection\.

## Transitive Peering<a name="transitive-peering"></a>

You have a VPC peering connection between VPC A and VPC B \(`pcx-aaaabbbb`\), and between VPC A and VPC C \(`pcx-aaaacccc`\)\. There is no VPC peering connection between VPC B and VPC C\. You cannot route packets directly from VPC B to VPC C through VPC A\. 

![\[Transitive peering\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/images/transitive-peering-diagram.png)

To route packets directly between VPC B and VPC C, you can create a separate VPC peering connection between them \(provided they do not have overlapping CIDR blocks\)\. For more information, see [Three VPCs Peered Together](peering-configurations-full-access.md#three-vpcs-full-access)\.

## Edge to Edge Routing Through a Gateway or Private Connection<a name="edge-to-edge-vgw"></a>

If either VPC in a peering relationship has one of the following connections, you cannot extend the peering relationship to that connection:
+ A VPN connection or an AWS Direct Connect connection to a corporate network
+ An internet connection through an internet gateway
+ An internet connection in a private subnet through a NAT device
+ A VPC endpoint to an AWS service; for example, an endpoint to Amazon S3\.
+ \(IPv6\) A ClassicLink connection\. You can enable IPv4 communication between a linked EC2\-Classic instance and instances in a VPC on the other side of a VPC peering connection\. However, IPv6 is not supported in EC2\-Classic, so you cannot extend this connection for IPv6 communication\.

For example, if VPC A and VPC B are peered, and VPC A has any of these connections, then instances in VPC B cannot use the connection to access resources on the other side of the connection\. Similarly, resources on the other side of a connection cannot use the connection to access VPC B\.

**Example: Edge to Edge Routing Through a VPN Connection or an AWS Direct Connect Connection**

You have a VPC peering connection between VPC A and VPC B \(`pcx-aaaabbbb`\)\. VPC A also has a VPN connection or an AWS Direct Connect connection to a corporate network\. Edge to edge routing is not supported; you cannot use VPC A to extend the peering relationship to exist between VPC B and the corporate network\. For example, traffic from the corporate network can’t directly access VPC B by using the VPN connection or the AWS Direct Connect connection to VPC A\.

**Example: Edge to Edge Routing Through an Internet Gateway**

You have a VPC peering connection between VPC A and VPC B \(`pcx-abababab`\)\. VPC A has an internet gateway; VPC B does not\. Edge to edge routing is not supported; you cannot use VPC A to extend the peering relationship to exist between VPC B and the internet\. For example, traffic from the internet can’t directly access VPC B by using the internet gateway connection to VPC A\. 

![\[Edge to edge routing through an internet gateway\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/images/edge-to-edge-igw-diagram.png)

Similarly, if VPC A has a NAT device that provides internet access to instances in private subnets in VPC A, instances in VPC B cannot use the NAT device to access the internet\.


**Example: Example: Edge to Edge Routing Through a VPC endpoint**

You have a VPC peering connection between VPC A and VPC B (`pcx-abababab`). VPC A has a VPC endpoint to S3; VPC B does not. 
Edge to edge routing is not supported; you cannot use VPC A to extend the peering relationship to exist between VPC B and S3. 
For example, traffic from S3 can’t directly access VPC B by using the VPC endpoint connection to VPC A.
